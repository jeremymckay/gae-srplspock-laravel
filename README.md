nc-study-group


One of the example programs provided by Thomas Rideout  of the nc-study-group  (SDPHP) was a scissor rock paper lizard spock  simulation built on laravel.  I wanted to see if I could put it on Google App Engine (GAE).  I followed instructions on https://gae-php-tips.appspot.com/2013/10/22/getting-started-with-laravel-on-php-for-app-engine/

More on this later
